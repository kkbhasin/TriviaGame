# TriviaGame

This is a simple timer game. When you press the start button, a Game of Thrones themed Trivia Game will start. Answer the questions as best you can. If the timer reaches 0 or you answer a question, an answer page will be displayed and you will be notified if you guess correctly or incorrectly (or not at all). The page will automatically move on to the next question. Brush up on your GoT before you start. Enjoy!
